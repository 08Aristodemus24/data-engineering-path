DE financial aid course:
I am quite frankly still a student trying to build his way into having a better career in data engineering which I know will help my prospects in the future, and I firmly believe that this course on data engineering will help me so much in ways that I can use for the industry I am to endeavor in which is hopefully in this industry applied to business, or at the least an entry level role in it. I am applying for a financial aid because given my current situation I cannot at the moment being an unemployed student be able to pay for these tremendously helpful resources, and I hope I can benefit still from these resources given my situation. And I hope to repay this debt in whatever way I can given that it has helped me as I said in more ways than I can describe, and I hope that by providing me with the necessary resources to help me build my future prospects I can one day hopefully repay everything I owe that helped me get where I am now.

As I'm currently unemployed this course I believe will help my chances in landing a well paid job as a data engineer, I believe that through upskilling and learning through courses like these it helps better sharpen my skills and learn different technologies which I expect will help me navigate through the role I am to and about to partake in hopefully in the future in the workplace. This course might also help me with my aforementioned goals by allowing me to learn about best practices and what to expect when I finally hopefully arrive at a potential role as a data engineer as I believe that having a grasp or understanding of these things will help me be able to do my potential job better and build hopefully pipelines and applications seamlessly without having to make big mistakes along the way, in this journey. I hope you can consider the situation I am in thank you.
